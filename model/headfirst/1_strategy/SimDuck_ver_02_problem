Now using interface looks like cover some problem.
But other problem occurs.
The interface has no java code. So programmer can't reuse code!

How to solve :

	1. we have to think which part of application would not change and change.

	2. "Encapsulation"
	
	3. Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the 
	   data(member data), and method(member method) together as a single unit.
	
	4. In encapsulation data of a class will be hidden from other classes, 
	   and can be accessed only through the methods(getter,setter) of their 
	   current class, therefor it is also known as data hiding.
	
	5. To achieve encapsulation in JAVA
	   * Declare the variables of a class as private.
	   * Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables valuse.



Benefits of Encapsulation : 

	1. The fields of a class can be made read-only or write-only.
	2. A class can hava total control over what is stored in its fields.
	3. The users of a class don't know how the class stores its data.
	4. A class can change the data type of a field and users of the class do not 
	   need to change any of their code.
	   (if, client want other services / change th environment-like DB,other data 		type)
	   

What you should remember 
"All the patterns are mechanism of change teal during the part of the system to other parts independently".
