There is only cheesePizza, greekPizza, pepperoniPizza now.
What if we have to add new menu there??
Then programmer must change body of orderPizza method....
It against to OCP.
Also now we know where can be changed.
So we have to seperate that part from the orderPizza method body.
This process name is "encapsulation".
