clientDoor_ver_01_CD has a proble.
Because if there is more door type then programmer should type more about other door.
Which mean that is really not good. When we graduate and work out there are lots of cases and type of Door(just for example...)

Also in Client class there must have logic that compare of Door type.

So, make Door class and make inheritance relationship between Door(super class) and AutomaticDoor,KnobDoor,SlidingDoor (sub class) .
